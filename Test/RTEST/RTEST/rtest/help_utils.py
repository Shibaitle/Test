COMPARISON CRITERIA:

Header Row:

‚Ä¢ This helps the tool identify column names correctly

Column Selection:
‚Ä¢ Team Column: Select the column containing team information
‚Ä¢ App Name Column: Select the column with application names  
‚Ä¢ Category Column: Select the column with category data

Additional Criteria:
‚Ä¢ Click "+ Add Criteria Column" to add more matching columns
‚Ä¢ Useful for complex matching requirements
‚Ä¢ Each additional column becomes part of the row matching key

Formula-Aware Processing:
‚Ä¢ When enabled, the tool detects and preserves formula columns
‚Ä¢ Prevents overwriting calculated values
‚Ä¢ Updates source data that formulas reference instead

MATCHING PROCESS:
Rows are matched based on the combination of all selected criteria columns.
Only rows with matching criteria will be updated.

FILTER CRITERIA:

Use filters to limit which rows are processed:

Basic Filters:
‚Ä¢ Team Filters: Only process rows with specific team values
‚Ä¢ App Name Filters: Only process rows with specific app names
‚Ä¢ Category Filters: Only process rows with specific categories

Adding Filters:
‚Ä¢ Click the "+" button to add multiple filter values for each type
‚Ä¢ Click the "üîç" button to see available values from your file
‚Ä¢ Leave filters empty to process all rows

Additional Filter Criteria:
‚Ä¢ Click "‚ûï Add Filter Criteria" to create filters for additional columns
‚Ä¢ Useful when you have custom comparison criteria
‚Ä¢ Each filter type works independently

FILTER LOGIC:
‚Ä¢ Multiple filters of the same type work as OR (any match passes)
‚Ä¢ Different filter types work as AND (all must match)
‚Ä¢ Empty filters are ignored (no filtering applied)

Example: If you set Team filter to "Development" and App filter to "WebApp", 
only rows with Team="Development" AND App="WebApp" will be processed.

Additional Options:
‚Ä¢ Create highlighted file: Generates an Excel file with changes highlighted in yellow
‚Ä¢ Show update popup: Displays which rows were updated after processing
‚Ä¢ Clear file selection: Automatically clears file paths after successful update

OUTPUT FILES:
When creating new files, the tool automatically generates descriptive names:
‚Ä¢ Includes filter information if filters were used
‚Ä¢ Indicates the comparison mode used
‚Ä¢ Preserves the original file extension

HIGHLIGHTED FILES:
‚Ä¢ Changes are highlighted in yellow

CUSTOM COMPARISON CRITERIA:

This mode allows flexible row matching using any columns as keys.

Key Columns:
‚Ä¢ Define which columns uniquely identify each row
‚Ä¢ Rows are matched when ALL key column values are identical
‚Ä¢ You can use multiple key columns for complex matching

Steps:
1. Set the header row number
2. Click "Load Columns" to load available columns
3. Click "+ Add Key Column" to add matching criteria
4. Select the appropriate column for each key

Examples:
‚Ä¢ Single key: Use "ID" column for unique identifier matching
‚Ä¢ Multiple keys: Use "Department" + "Employee Name" for composite matching
‚Ä¢ Complex keys: Use "Project" + "Phase" + "Task" for detailed matching

IMPORTANT:
‚Ä¢ At least one key column is required
‚Ä¢ All key columns must exist in both files
‚Ä¢ Key combinations should be unique within each file
‚Ä¢ Missing or empty key values are ignored

This mode is ideal for files with non-standard structures or when you need 
more control over how rows are matched between files.

CUSTOM FILTER CRITERIA:

Create filters based on your custom key columns.

Adding Custom Filters:
1. Ensure you have defined key columns first
2. Click "+ Add Custom Filter"
3. Select which key column to filter on
4. Add filter values for that column

Filter Management:
‚Ä¢ Each key column can have its own filter
‚Ä¢ Add multiple values per filter using the "+" button
‚Ä¢ Use "üîç" to browse available values from your file
‚Ä¢ Remove unwanted filter values with "‚ùå"

Filter Logic:
‚Ä¢ Multiple values for the same column work as OR
‚Ä¢ Multiple column filters work as AND
‚Ä¢ Empty filters are ignored

Example:
If you have key columns "Department" and "Status", you can:
‚Ä¢ Filter Department for "Sales" OR "Marketing" 
‚Ä¢ AND filter Status for "Active"
‚Ä¢ This processes only active sales and marketing records

Custom filters give you precise control over which data gets updated
based on your specific key column structure.
